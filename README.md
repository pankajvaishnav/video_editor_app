```bash
flutter run
```

#### Release Mode
```bash
flutter run --release
```

## Build Instructions

### Android APK
```bash
flutter build apk --release

```

## Usage

### 1. Import Video
- Tap the "Import Video" button on the welcome screen
- Select a video file from your device
- The video will be loaded and ready for editing

### 2. Split Segments
- Select a segment by tapping on it in the timeline
- Use the video controls to navigate to the desired split position
- Tap the "Split" button to divide the segment

### 3. Delete Segments
- Long-press on a segment to delete it
- Or select a segment and use the delete button
- Deleted segments are marked but can be restored

### 4. Skip Mode
- Enable "Skip Mode" to preview the final result
- Playback will automatically skip over deleted segments
- Useful for reviewing your edit before export

### 5. Export Video
- Tap the "Export" button
- Choose from export options:
  - Export All Segments
  - Export Selected Only
  - Custom Export (quality/format settings)
- Share the export configuration file

## Current Limitations

### Technical Limitations
1. **No Actual Video Processing**: The app generates export configuration files instead of processing actual video files. Real video processing would require:
   - FFmpeg integration
   - Native platform video processing APIs
   - Significant processing power and time

2. **Export Format**: Currently exports configuration files (.txt) rather than processed video files

3. **Video Codec Support**: Limited by Flutter's video_player plugin capabilities

4. **Performance**: Large video files may cause performance issues on lower-end devices

### Feature Limitations
1. **No Audio Editing**: The app doesn't provide audio track manipulation
2. **No Transitions**: No support for transitions between segments
3. **No Effects**: No video effects, filters, or color correction
4. **Single Video Track**: Cannot handle multiple video tracks or picture-in-picture
5. **No Undo/Redo**: No undo/redo functionality for edit operations

### Platform Limitations
1. **File Access**: Depends on platform-specific file access permissions
2. **Storage**: Limited by device storage capacity
3. **Processing Power**: Complex operations may be slow on older devices

## Architecture Notes

The app uses a single-file architecture for simplicity but should be refactored for production:

### Recommended Architecture
```
lib/
├── main.dart
├── models/
│   ├── video_segment.dart
│   ├── export_settings.dart
│   └── project_state.dart
├── services/
│   ├── video_service.dart
│   ├── export_service.dart
│   └── file_service.dart
├── screens/
│   ├── welcome_screen.dart
│   ├── editor_screen.dart
│   └── export_screen.dart
├── widgets/
│   ├── video_player/
│   ├── timeline/
│   └── controls/
└── utils/
    ├── formatters.dart
    └── constants.dart
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Large video files can consume significant memory
- Implement video thumbnail generation for timeline display
- Use lazy loading for segment previews

### Processing Optimization
- Implement background processing for exports
- Use isolates for heavy computations
- Add progress indicators for long operations

### UI Responsiveness
- Implement proper loading states
- Use efficient list rendering for large segment lists
- Optimize animations for smooth performance
